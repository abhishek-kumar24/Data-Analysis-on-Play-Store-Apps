## Wrestle the Android App Store Data into Beautiful Looking Charts with Plotly ðŸš€


> Have you ever thought about building your own an iOS or Android app? If so, then you probably have wondered about how things work in the app stores. We replicated some of the app store analytics provided by companies like App Annie or Sensor Tower that helps inform development and app marketing strategies for many companies! ðŸ˜€



- We compared thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:

- How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are

- Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity

- How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free

- How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app

- Which paid apps have had the highest revenue

- How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue



## What I've learned:

âœ… How to quickly remove duplicates
